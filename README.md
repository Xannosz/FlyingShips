With this mod you can build amazing flying ships, water ships and submarines. (Or you can build ugly ships, I won't even see your map anyway)

There's no need for anything but a rudder block and a wand. Accessories include a tank and a heater for the steam powered flight and ender oscillators for the ender pearl powered ships.

Not enough? Then we will give not one but two rudder blocks. Yes, there are definitely two rudder blocks, in one mod, a rudder block and a sub-rudder block.
