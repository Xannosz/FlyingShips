// known bugs
- item frames sometimes broken during jump

// bugs/optimization
- terrain scan detect swim and cloud reachability

// pre-release
- artificial floater (like wool, just better) (crystal of levitation [no fall damage, when in hand])

- todo remove
- graphical cool down

// release
- tests
- better logo (rudder block)
- wiki
- license
- correct description in configuration file
