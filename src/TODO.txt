// known bugs
- item frames sometimes broken during jump

// bugs/optimization
- terrain scan detect swim and cloud reachability

// beta
- ender engine system
- heat/steam system
- cool down
- collusion check on y

// pre-release
- artificial floater (like wool, just better) (crystal of levitation [no fall damage, when in hand])
- coordinate relative to marker

// release
- tests
- better logo (rudder block)
- wiki
- license
- correct description in configuration file
- description in toml file
- hu lang

//better ui
- show helper text after some time

- graphical debug without texture
- animated steam, water structure
- question before delete rectangle/coordinate
- show absolute coordinates in settings in a tooltip
